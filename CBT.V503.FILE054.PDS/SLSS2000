  %Edit+allows you to modify or delete a selected manual.

   You must first select the manual that is to be edited from the selection
   screen.  Scrolling is performed by means of the Scroll command.

   The top right hand corner of the edit seletion screen will supply the
   library name and sort sequence if sorted.

   Locating a manual can be done one of two ways.  The user can scroll the
   selection screen until the manual is found and then select the manual or if
   the Manual ID is known the user can enter the ID in the Option field and
   press enter.  If the manual is located an automatic scroll of the  library
   will be performed and the manual will be the first one shown on the
   selection screen.  If not found the user will be notified by use of the
   caution screen.
