  %Browse+allows you to display data contained within a selected library in a
   full screen format.

   You can scroll the data in two directions (up or down) by a half page or
   full page, or by any number of lines.  Scrolling is performed by means of
   the scroll commands.

   The top right hand corner of the browse screen will supply the selected
   library name and sort sequence if sorted.

   Once a manual is located it can be selected by entering a 'S' in front of
   the Manual ID field.  Detail information will then be displayed for the
   selected manual.
